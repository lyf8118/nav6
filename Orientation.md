The nav6 IMU can measure a total of 9 axes (3 gyroscope axes, 3 accelerometer axes and 3 magnetometer axes).  In order to effectively use the values reported by the nav6, the orientation and polarity of these 3 axes must be understood.

**The standard nav6 board orientation is with the nav6 logo on the _Rear Left_.**


|Axis|AKA|Points to...|Increases as...|
|:---|:--|:-----------|:--------------|
|X |Pitch|Right side of the nav6|the nav6 right side lifts|
|Y |Roll|Front of the nav6|the nav6 front side lifts|
|Z |Yaw|Up from the top of the nav6|the nav6 rotates to the right.|
