[Design files](https://code.google.com/p/nav6/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fenclosure) for enclosure to help protect and mount the nav6 IMU are made freely available.  These files, in STL (Stereo Lithography) file format, may be printed using a 3D printer.

The provided enclosure design is comprised of two parts - a "base" and a "lid" - which are shown below:

Alternatively, an enclosure can be fashioned from existing items, such as a small plastic tool box.  The key features of a well-designed enclosure include:<br>
<br>
<ul><li>The enclosure protects its contents from damage.<br>
</li><li>The enclosure can be securely mounted (e.g., to a robot chassis).<br>
</li><li>The enclosure can provide strain relief for any cables which enter/exit the enclosure.<br>
</li><li>The enclosure can be opened if necessary to service its contents.
